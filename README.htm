<h1>Compute All Permutations</h1>
<p>A class called Solution that takes two 
arguments, a BufferedReader from which to read inputs and a PrintWriter on which 
to write output, and which may throw an IOException.</p>

<h2><u>Input:</u></h2>
<p>Each line of input coming in on the BufferedReader represents a separate 
problem.&nbsp; <i>(Hint: Consider using the readLine() method in the BufferedReader 
class.)</i>&nbsp; Each line will consist of a comma separated list of strings.<i> 
(Hint: Consider using the StringTokenizer class.)&nbsp; </i></p>
<h2><u>Output:</u></h2>
<p>For each such line of input, you must write out onto the output all the 
possible permutations (orderings) of the input line, followed by a single blank 
line.&nbsp; The order in which you list the permutations does not matter.</p>
<h2><u>End of Input:</u></h2>
<p>The input will be terminated by a blank line.&nbsp; Once this blank line is 
reached on the input, simply output one more blank line on the output and then 
immediately return control to the caller (i.e. exit from the run function).</p>
<h2><u>Example:</u></h2>
<p>For example, if the input coming in on the BufferedReader looked like:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">red,yellow<br>
one,two,three<br>
</font><br>
the output on the PrintWriter should look like:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">red,yellow<br>
yellow,red<br>
<br>
one,two,three<br>
one,three,two<br>
two,one,three<br>
two,three,one<br>
three,one,two<br>
three,two,one</font><br>
